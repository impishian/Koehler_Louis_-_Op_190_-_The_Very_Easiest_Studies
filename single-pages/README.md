# Compiling PDF scores as single-pages from this directory within the Repository:
## Louis Köhler
###40 easy Studies; Op. 70 

If you want to use [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org) to compile single pages from this directory,
you will need to download/clone the whole repository since there is other files used as `includes`
from different directories such as the `copyright.ily` from `../global-files`  

This might not make to much sence for the very short peices in the beginning and seems to be rather
usefull for the later pieces from Nr. 16 onwards.
